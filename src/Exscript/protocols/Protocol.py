class Protocol(object):
    """
    This is the base class for all protocols; it defines the common portions
    of the API.

    The goal of all protocol classes is to provide an interface that
    is unified accross protocols, such that the adapters may be used
    interchangably without changing any other code.

    In order to achieve this, the main challenge are the differences
    arising from the authentication methods that are used.
    The reason is that many devices may support the following variety
    authentification/authorization methods:

        1. Protocol level authentification, such as SSH's built-in
           authentication.

                - p1: password only
                - p2: username
                - p3: username + password
                - p4: username + key
                - p5: username + key + password

        2. App level authentification, such that the authentification may
           happen long after a connection is already accepted.
           This type of authentication is normally used in combination with
           Telnet, but some SSH hosts also do this (users have reported
           devices from Enterasys). These devices may also combine
           protocol-level authentification with app-level authentification.
           The following types of app-level authentication exist:

                - a1: password only
                - a2: username
                - a3: username + password

        3. App level authorization: In order to implement the AAA protocol,
           some devices ask for two separate app-level logins, whereas the
           first serves to authenticate the user, and the second serves to
           authorize him.
           App-level authorization may support the same methods as app-level
           authentification:

                - A1: password only
                - A2: username
                - A3: username + password

    We are assuming that the following methods are used:

        - Telnet:

          - p1 - p5: never
          - a1 - a3: optional
          - A1 - A3: optional

        - SSH:

          - p1 - p5: optional
          - a1 - a3: optional
          - A1 - A3: optional

    To achieve authentication method compatibility accross different
    protocols, we must hide all this complexity behind one single API
    call, and figure out which ones are supported.

    As a use-case, our goal is that the following code will always work,
    regardless of which combination of authentication methods a device
    supports::

        key = PrivateKey.from_file('~/.ssh/id_rsa', 'my_key_password')

        # The user account to use for protocol level authentification.
        # The key defaults to None, in which case key authentication is
        # not attempted.
        account = Account(name     = 'myuser',
                          password = 'mypassword',
                          key      = key)

        # The account to use for app-level authentification.
        # password2 defaults to password.
        app_account = Account(name      = 'myuser',
                              password  = 'my_app_password',
                              password2 = 'my_app_password2')

        # app_account defaults to account.
        conn.login(account, app_account = None, flush = True)

    Another important consideration is that once the login is complete, the
    device must be in a clearly defined state, i.e. we need to
    have processed the data that was retrieved from the connected host.

    More precisely, the buffer that contains the incoming data must be in
    a state such that the following call to expect_prompt() will either
    always work, or always fail.

    We jhide the following methods behind the login() call::

        # Protocol level authentification.
        conn.protocol_authenticate(...)
        # App-level authentification.
        conn.app_authenticate(...)
        # App-level authorization.
        conn.app_authorize(...)

    The code produces the following result::

        Telnet:
            conn.protocol_authenticate -> NOP
            conn.app_authenticate
                -> waits for username or password prompt, authenticates,
                   returns after a CLI prompt was seen.
            conn.app_authorize
                -> calls driver.enable(), waits for username or password
                   prompt, authorizes, returns after a CLI prompt was seen.

        SSH:
            conn.protocol_authenticate -> authenticates using user/key/password
            conn.app_authenticate -> like Telnet
            conn.app_authorize -> like Telnet

    We can see the following:

        - protocol_authenticate() must not wait for a prompt, because else
          app_authenticate() has no way of knowing whether an app-level
          login is even necessary.

        - app_authenticate() must check the buffer first, to see if
          authentication has already succeeded. In the case that
          app_authenticate() is not necessary (i.e. the buffer contains a
          CLI prompt), it just returns.

          app_authenticate() must NOT eat the prompt from the buffer, because
          else the result may be inconsistent with devices that do not do
          any authentication; i.e., when app_authenticate() is not called.

        - Since the prompt must still be contained in the buffer,
          conn.driver.app_authorize() needs to eat it before it sends the
          command for starting the authorization procedure.

          This has a drawback - if a user attempts to call app_authorize()
          at a time where there is no prompt in the buffer, it would fail.
          So we need to eat the prompt only in cases where we know that
          auto_app_authorize() will attempt to execute a command. Hence
          the driver requires the Driver.supports_auto_authorize() method.

          However, app_authorize() must not eat the CLI prompt that follows.

        - Once all logins are processed, it makes sense to eat the prompt
          depending on the wait parameter. Wait should default to True,
          because it's better that the connection stalls waiting forever,
          than to risk that an error is not immediately discovered due to
          timing issues (this is a race condition that I'm not going to
          detail here).
